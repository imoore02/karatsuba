# Karatsuba Multiplication Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the **Karatsuba multiplication algorithm**, an efficient divide-and-conquer approach for multiplying large numbers. Unlike traditional multiplication methods, Karatsuba reduces the number of required multiplications, significantly improving performance for large inputs.  

## Features  
- Supports multiplication of **large numbers** in **any numerical base**.  
- Implements the **divide-and-conquer Karatsuba algorithm** for enhanced efficiency.  

## How It Works  
The Karatsuba algorithm improves multiplication efficiency using the formula:  

\[
X \times Y = (A \times B) \times 10^{2m} + [(A \times D) + (C \times B)] \times 10^m + (C \times D)
\]

where:  
- **X and Y** are the two numbers being multiplied,  
- **A, B, C, D** are split parts of the numbers,  
- **m** is the half-length of the numbers.
